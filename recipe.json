If you prefer your steak medium or medium-well, cook your steak longer.\n\nTo test the doneness of your steak, lightly press the tip of your left index finger to the tip of your left thumb. The fleshy area below the thumb should feel how rare steak feels pressing the surface of the steak. For medium-rare steak, touch your middle finger to your thumb and press the area below your thumb. For medium, touch your fourth finger to your thumb. For well done, touch your pinky to your thumb.\n\nRest the steak for 10 minutes on a cutting board. Slice, then serve!"
